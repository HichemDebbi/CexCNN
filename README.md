# CexCNN
 CexCNN is a causal explanation technique for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CexCNN helps to identify the most important features in the input image tha contributed to a CNN's decision. Besides, it shows good results in Weakly Supervised Object Localization(WSOL), and can be used as well as a pruning technique.
